## This project was created in a New India Vibrant hackathon for the security department, addressing the problem of fake profile detection and reporting according to the organizer's demand.

We created a Twitter-specific application where we used Twitter API to extract details of an account that was reported spam by the user. The profile then undergoes the following detection searching in the recent tweets of the user:
- Checking for any online bullying
- Checking for any false information
- Checking for any phishing link
