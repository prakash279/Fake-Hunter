## This project was created in a New India Vibrant hackathon for the security department, addressing the problem of fake profile detection and reporting according to the organizer's demand.

We created a Twitter-specific application where we used Twitter API to extract details of an account that was reported spam by the user. The profile then undergoes the following detection searching in the recent tweets of the user:
- Checking for any online bullying
- Checking for any false information
- Checking for any phishing link

#### The Flowchart below represents how the flow of our model worked once a Twitter profile was to be checked in the system and it generated a score which was then considered with the thresholds appropriate actions will be taken by the cyber cell department.
