## This project was created in a New India Vibrant hackathon for the security department, addressing the problem of fake profile detection and reporting according to the organizer's demand.

We created a Twitter-specific application where we used Twitter API to extract details of an account that was reported spam by the user. The profile then undergoes the following detection searching in the recent tweets of the user:
- Checking for any online bullying
- Checking for any false information
- Checking for any phishing link

#### The Flowchart below represents how the flow of our model worked once a Twitter profile was to be checked in the system and it generated a score which was then considered with the thresholds appropriate actions will be taken by the cyber cell department.

We faced many challenges during the hackathon we prepared the solution early, but according to the demands of our reviewers and mentors on the spot with very limited time of 3-4 hours, we created a prototype of their demands and suggestions which eventually helped us secure the runner up position in the hackathon.
- The most time given on the discussion and question was about impersonation of celebrities.
- We thought to use the engagement metrics and use it in creating the score, and leave the threshold on the cyber cell department.

These were some of the most important things we worked on in the final 3-4 hours of the hackathon as we were demanded this in the last round by the reviewers, we also had to work with the documentation and preparing for the presentation. All the adrenaline and pressure were fun and tiring at the same time. It was fun experience and I am very proud of my team and how this event went smoothly without much friction.
